# Engagement Strategy

## Daily Routine (30 min)

1. Respond to all comments on your posts (5 min)
2. Comment on 5-10 posts from target accounts (15 min)
3. Share/repost with added insight (5 min)
4. Send 2-3 DMs to new connections (5 min)

## Quality Comments

- Add new insight, not just "Great post!"
- Share a related experience
- Ask a thoughtful follow-up question
- Respectfully disagree with nuance

## Building Relationships

- Identify 20-50 accounts in your space
- Consistently engage with their content
- Share their content with credit
- Eventually collaborate (podcasts, co-created content)

## Handling Negative Comments

- Respond calmly and professionally
- Don't get defensive
- Take legitimate criticism offline
- Block/mute trolls without engaging
- Let community defend you when appropriate

**Stuck:**

- Ask your audience what they want
- Comment on industry news
- Share a failure or lesson learned
