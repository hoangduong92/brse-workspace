# Instagram Strategy

**Best for:** Visual brands, lifestyle, e-commerce, younger demographics
**Audience:** 18-44, visual-first consumers
**Frequency:** 1-2 feed posts/day, 3-10 Stories/day
**Best times:** 11am-1pm, 7-9pm

## What Works

- High-quality visuals
- Behind-the-scenes Stories
- Reels (short-form video)
- Carousels with value
- User-generated content
- Interactive Stories (polls, questions)

## What Doesn't

- Low-quality images
- Too much text in images
- Ignoring Stories and Reels
- Only promotional content

## Format Tips

- Reels get 2x reach of static posts
- First frame of Reels must hook
- Carousels: 10 slides with educational content
- Use all Story features (polls, links, etc.)

## Algorithm Tips

- Reels heavily prioritized over static posts
- Saves and shares > likes
- Stories keep you top of feed
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Use all features (polls, questions, etc.)
