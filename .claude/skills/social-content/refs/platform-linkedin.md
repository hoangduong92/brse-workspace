# LinkedIn Strategy

**Best for:** B2B, thought leadership, professional networking, recruiting
**Audience:** Professionals, decision-makers, job seekers
**Frequency:** 3-5x/week
**Best times:** Tue-Thu, 7-8am, 12pm, 5-6pm

## What Works

- Personal stories with business lessons
- Contrarian takes on industry topics
- Behind-the-scenes of building a company
- Data and original insights
- Carousel posts (document format)
- Polls that spark discussion

## What Doesn't

- Overly promotional content
- Generic motivational quotes
- Links in main post (kills reach)
- Corporate speak without personality

## Format Tips

- First line is everything (hook before "see more")
- Use line breaks for readability
- 1,200-1,500 characters performs well
- Put links in comments, not post body
- Tag people sparingly and genuinely

## Algorithm Tips

- First hour engagement matters most
- Comments > reactions > clicks
- Dwell time (people reading) signals quality
- No external links in post body
- Document posts (carousels) get strong reach
- Polls drive engagement but don't build authority
