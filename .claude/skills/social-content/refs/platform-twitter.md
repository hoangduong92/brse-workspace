# Twitter/X Strategy

**Best for:** Tech, media, real-time commentary, community building
**Audience:** Tech-savvy, news-oriented, niche communities
**Frequency:** 3-10x/day (including replies)

## What Works

- Hot takes and opinions
- Threads that teach something

## What Doesn't

- Pure self-promotion
- Threads without strong hook
- Ignoring replies and mentions
- Scheduling everything (no real-time presence)

## Format Tips

- Tweets under 100 characters get more engagement
- Threads: Hook in tweet 1, promise value, deliver
- Quote tweets with added insight beat plain retweets
- Use visuals to stop the scroll

## Algorithm Tips
