# Reverse Engineering Viral Content

Systematically analyze top-performing content to extract proven patterns.

## 6-Step Framework

### 1. NICHE ID — Find Top Creators

Identify 10-20 creators in your space with high engagement.

**Criteria:** Posting 3+/week, high engagement rate, audience overlap
**Where:** LinkedIn search, Twitter follows, SparkToro, industry newsletters

### 2. SCRAPE — Collect Posts

Gather 500-1000+ posts for analysis.

**Tools:** Apify, Phantom Buster, export features, manual collection
**Data:** Post text, engagement, format, time, hook, CTA, topic

### 3. ANALYZE — Extract Patterns

**Quantitative:** Rank by engagement, identify top 10%, format patterns, timing
**Qualitative:** Hooks, length, emotional triggers, formats, topics

### 4. PLAYBOOK — Codify Patterns

**Hook patterns:**
```
"I [unexpected action] and [surprising result]"
"[Number] [things] that [outcome]:"
"[Controversial take]"
```

**Format patterns:**
- Carousel: Hook → Problem → Solution → CTA
- Thread: Hook → Promise → Deliver → CTA
- Story: Hook → Setup → Conflict → Resolution → Lesson

**CTA patterns:** "What would you add?" | "Agree or disagree?" | "Save for later"

### 5. LAYER VOICE — Apply Direct Response

**"Smart friend who figured something out"**
- Write like texting advice to a friend
- "I found that..." not "You should..."

**Specific > Vague**
- ❌ "I made good revenue" → ✅ "I made $47,329"
- ❌ "It took a while" → ✅ "It took 47 days"

**Short. Breathe. Land.**
- One idea per sentence, use line breaks, create rhythm

**Write from emotion**
- Start with how you felt, use emotional words, show vulnerability

### 6. CONVERT — Turn Attention into Action

**Soft:** Newsletter in bio, free resources, DM triggers
**Direct:** Link in comments, contextual mentions, case studies
