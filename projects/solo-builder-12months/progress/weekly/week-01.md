## Time & Energy

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Hours Planned | 20 |

## 📝 Learnings (Day 1)

### React/Next.js
1. **File-based routing**: folder = URL
2. **Link vs `<a>`**: Client-side navigation
3. **Layout vs Page**: Layout wraps, Page changes
4. **Server vs Client**: "use client" for useState/onClick

### State Management
5. **useState**: State giữ data giữa renders
6. **useEffect**: Side effects after render
7. **Dependency array**: `[]` = once, `[x]` = when x changes
8. **localStorage**: Persist data in browser

### DevOps
9. **Vercel CI/CD**: Push GitHub → auto-deploy
10. **Serverless**: Code runs on-demand
